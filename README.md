# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Online-Restaurant-Reviews
Web Scrapping, ML for Categorization and Sentiment Analysis

This project analysis Online Restaurant Text Reviews that were left on Yelp by customers. 

We have identified that the Overall Stars Reviews are not a good indicator of a restaurant as customers have different criterias of a "good restaurant".
For example, Customer A leaves a 5 star review because she believed that the Ambience of the restaurant was great even though the Taste of the food was terrible. 
If Customer B, who values the Taste of food over the Ambience of the restaurants, heeds the review of Customer A, he would be very disappointed with the restuarant. 

Our analysis aims to categorize Textual Reviews from Yelp into 5 main categories: Taste, Price, Ambience, Service and Others; and perform Sentiment analysis to break down 
customers' reviews into more specific fields such that the reviews would be more helpful for potential customers who come to view reviews left by previous patreons without 
them having to exert more effort in writing the reviews.
